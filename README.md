# Simple web calculator for educational purposes

This educational project is a simple web calculator to perform simple math operations.

Stack used: 
[AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/).
HTML5
CSS

You can use it as a way to learn how to develop apps based off AngularJS

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the web-calculator repository.

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the web calculator repository. You can get git from
[http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

We also use a number of node.js tools to initialize and test angular-seed. You must have node.js and
its package manager (npm) installed.  You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

### Running the App during Development

The angular-seed project comes preconfigured with a local development webserver.  It is a node.js
tool called [http-server][http-server].  You can start this webserver with `npm start` but you may choose to
install the tool globally:

```
sudo npm install -g http-server
```

Then you can start your own development web server to serve static files from a folder by
running:

```
http-server -a localhost -p 8000
```

Alternatively, you can choose to configure your own webserver, such as apache or nginx. Just
configure your server to serve the files under the `app/` directory.
